      <description>The following photos I took for a property. We did not use these photos to show the property, since there was already a different photographer booked for the gig. That said I took these photos to demonstrate what I can do. The main difference between my photos and that of the professional photographer was that the photographer used a full frame camera and kept the photos blown out more, aka very bright and less saturated.</description>
