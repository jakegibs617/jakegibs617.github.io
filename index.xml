      <description>This was a paint job I took where I first started by using photoshop to help my client decide a color for the walls. After a few rounds of feedback and design, my client made a choice to go with a blue in the bedroom, yellow in the living room, blue in the kitchen and yellow in the laundry room.

      <description>The following photos I took for a property. We did not use these photos to show the property, since there was already a different photographer booked for the gig. That said I took these photos to demonstrate what I can do. The main difference between my photos and that of the professional photographer was that the photographer used a full frame camera and kept the photos blown out more, aka very bright and less saturated.</description>
